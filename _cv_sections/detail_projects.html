Some relevant projects I have been involved during the last years are:
<ul>
    <li><strong>PERIOD:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>MOSAR:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>PROACT:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>ADE:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>ERGO:</strong> Focused on delivering an advanced and flexible space autonomous framework with adaptable levels of autonomy. The framework includes mission planning, execution and monitoring along with path planning and trajectory control for both mobile robot base and robotic arms among other funcionalities.</li>
    <li><strong>GOTCHA:</strong> Aiming to develop a robotic autonomous controller for the space domain integrating an action-based planner. Its purpose is to enhance the autonomy capabilities on board space systems offering goal-based commanding and telemetry monitoring.</li>
</ul>
